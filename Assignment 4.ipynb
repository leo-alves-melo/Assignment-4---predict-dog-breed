    "1. Engineer your features. Here you do not have them for free. You need to think of possible ways for transforming the collected data into meaningful features. For some ideas, consider traditional features such as texture features, color features, bags of visual words or more powerful ones involving CNNs. If you cannot think of anything, talk to the professor for some ideas.\n",
